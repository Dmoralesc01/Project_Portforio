<h2 align="center"> Univariate Linear Regression </h2>

**Summary:** The purpose of this project is to implement all the machinery of gradient descent and linear regression on your own, without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels.

**Learning Objectives**
* Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch
* Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python
* Create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib

Task 1: Loading the Data and Libraries<br>
Task 2: Visualizing the Data<br>
Task 3: Compute the Cost 𝐽(𝜃)<br>
Task 4: Implement Gradient Descent from scratch in Python<br>
Task 5: Visualizing the Cost Function J(𝜃)<br>
Task 6: Plotting the Convergence<br>
Task 7: Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit<br>
Task 8: Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values<br>
