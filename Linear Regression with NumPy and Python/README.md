<h2 align="center"> Univariate Linear Regression </h2>

**Summary:** The purpose of this project is to implement all the machinery of gradient descent and linear regression on your own, without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels.

**Learning Objectives**
* Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch
* Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python
* Create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib
