<h2 align="center"> Univariate Linear Regression </h2>

**Summary:** The purpose of this project is to implement all the machinery of gradient descent and linear regression on your own, without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels.

**Learning Objectives**
* Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch
* Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python
* Create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib

Task 1: Loading the Data and Libraries
Task 2: Visualizing the Data
Task 3: Compute the Cost 𝐽(𝜃)
Task 4: Implement Gradient Descent from scratch in Python
Task 5: Visualizing the Cost Function J(𝜃)
Task 6: Plotting the Convergence
Task 7: Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit
Task 8: Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
